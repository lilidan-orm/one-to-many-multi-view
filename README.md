One-to-Many Multi-view
=
This repository contains the code for our paper "Multi-view Representation Learning with One-to-Many Dynamic Relationships", which is under review in the IEEE TNNLS journal.

Requirment
=
pytoch>=1.3.1  
python>=3.7.4  
numpy>=1.16.5  
scikit-learn>=0.21.3  
scipy>=1.3.1  

Dataset
=
The datasets used in the paper can be obtained through the following links [cloud1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gKAcKx3Gu2zzJieXfg7r1Dm4dveqGH84/view?usp=drive_link) or  [cloud2](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1a1BVH26zIcer_Qa8f-BbrA?pwd=g84z) (code) g84z

Usage
=
The code includes:  
* an example implementation of the model on the Reuters dataset
* an example clustering task  

You can get the following output by running multi_view_main.py  
(modify the dataset path in the multi_view_data.py)
